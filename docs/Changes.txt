22.06.2003 V1.05

 wasn't defined. -> No subclassing possible
-Notebook buttons are moved on Warp 4

 28.12.98 V1.04 (internal version)
-Bug corrected which caused opening of bubblepad with default values when LAUNCHPAD
 entry was present in AUTOSTART line of the config.sys. This bug was introduced with the
 setup strings of V1.03.

15.11.98 V1.03
New features:
-Option to disable reopening of drawers added.
-Option to remove each action button added.
-Setup strings added to ease automatic installation.
-Utility included to replace/unreplace the WPLaunchPad class

19.09.98 V1.02:
New features:      
-Hide drawer button feature added.                          
-Individual settings for BubblePads added.                                  
-Added saving of drawer state. Drawers are reopened on next reboot. Doesn't work with normal open/close 
                   
Fixed bugs:
-Positioning of help windows for launchpad at the top of the desktop corrected.
-Bug with broken references causing drawers to disapear fixed.                
-Moved button reordering from wpRefreshDrawer() to wpSetDrawerHWND(). This eliminates the flickering when opening drawers.   
-Install.exe always copied the english help-file in previous versions.

20.08.98 V1.01:
-Corrected stucking help window problem. Help windows are always properly destroyed now, even
 if drawers are set to autoclose.

-Corrected positioning of drawers. Drawers below or on the left of the launchpad were placed       
 with an offset to the launchpad.

16.08.98 V1.00a:

-Corrected bug in install.exe which sometimes prevented accepting of default installation directory.
-Workaround: fly over help window on some systems remains visible. When help stucks on the
 desktop move pointer over another button to get rid of it.

-First public version.
